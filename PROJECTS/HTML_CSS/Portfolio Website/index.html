            honed my skills by working on various projects and collaborating with peers, which gave me hands-on
            experience in building full-stack applications.</p>
        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Front-End Development:</b> Proficient in creating interactive and responsive user interfaces using
                React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focus on building seamless user experiences with a keen eye for

            <li><b>Back-End Development:</b> Experienced in developing robust server-side applications using Node.js and
                Express.js. I am skilled in working with databases, particularly MongoDB, to design and manage efficient

            <li><b>Version Control:</b> Comfortable using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration, ensuring
                code integrity and smooth project management.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Personal Interests</h1>
        <p>Staying updated with industry trends and continuously learning new skills is essential to me. I regularly
            take online courses, attend webinars, and read technical blogs to expand my knowledge and stay ahead in the
            ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
